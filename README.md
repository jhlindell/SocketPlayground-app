## Socket Playground
This project is a demo project created for a talk I am giving on socket.io to the Boulder React Meetup on August 27th. I wanted to create a simple application that highlights the simplicity of using socket.io, along with how well it integrates with redux and thunk for application state management. The various features of the app were designed with teaching in mind. Features were implemented in ways that demonstrate how to use various socket.io capabilities.

## App Features
The app uses React for the front end framework. To manage state, Redux is used in conjunction with Thunk. Material-ui is used along with Flexbox and CSSGrid for layout and styling.

The server is an Express server. Socket.io is used instead of Http and AJAX for real-time communication between server and the clients.
